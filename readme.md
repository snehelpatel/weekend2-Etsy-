### FUNCTIONAL ETSY PAGE

This week in dumping all of our newly developed skills into a one giant project, our cohort is recreating a page that shows various Etsy results.

We made great and tentative use of
1. the mysterious DOM
2. for loops to the point reliance
3. for each loops that didn't do what I anticipated. Although it's honestly unclear what I anticipated.
4. the following higher order functions for the purpose of navigating through arrays
  * map
  * reduce
  * filter
